# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview - World Weather Analysis

1.  The project creates prompts for beta testers to use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 

2.  From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map will be created.


## Resources
Will need a config file and google api key to run.
